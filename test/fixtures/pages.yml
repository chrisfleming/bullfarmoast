    Bodiam Castle
    =============
    
    With the outside  appearing intact, this castle build in 1385 makes a spectacular sight. The grounds can be visited for free
    and the castle can be viewed across the moat. The inside is largely ruined, however some of the towers can be climbed and the walls
    explored.
    
    We are only around 6 miles(10 km), a 10 minute drive  from Bodiam and our accommodation makes a prefect base from which to explore this and many other 
    [local attractions].

    Bedgebury Pinetum
    =================
   
    Bedgebury Pinetum (the National Pinetum) is a 1.3 km&sup2; park near Goudhurst in Kent, 
    England. It was set up by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Forestry Commission in 
    1924. It contains one of the most complete collection of conifers on one site anywhere 
    in the world (its name is based on a neologism of pine and arboretum). In 1929 what are 
    called 'Forest Plots' were set up to compare, under normal forest conditions, the growth 
    of somewhat uncommon species, both conifers and broadleaved. There are now over one 
    hundred such plots in the Pinetum.
   
    ![Trees](/assets/attractions/bedgebury/trees.jpg")

    Pashley Manor Gardens
    =====================
    
    A quintessential English Garden, located in South East England, surrounding a private Grade I listed
    timber-framed house, dating from 1550 and enlarged in 1720. The Gardens offer a sumptuous blend of romantic
    landscaping, imaginative plantings and fine old trees, fountains, springs and large ponds. Definitely one
    of our favourite gardens to visit and well worth stopping for an excellent lunch and tea.
